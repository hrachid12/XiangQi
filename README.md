# XiangQi
CS162 Portfolio Project - XiangQi (Chinese Chess)

A working implementation of the XiangQi boardgame. Requires an IDE that supports ANSI output. 

## Usage

Open and run the game.py file with an IDE that supports ANSI printing. The game will start and board will print to the terminal. It is a 2-player game. On their turn, each player selects a piece's start location and the desired end location. If the move is legal, the move is made and the game proceeds. Otherwise, the player is asked to try again.

## Roadmap

There are some known bugs with a few game ending situations. Once those are fixed, the game may be updated using PyGame.
